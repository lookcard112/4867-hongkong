			The method of egg tart is to put the crust in Pour a mixture of sugar, fresh milk, and eggs into the small round pot-shaped cake mold and put it in the oven.

		<div class="story_text2">
			<h3>Pineapple Buns with butter</h3><img src ="Image/PineappleBuns.jpg" width="500px"/>
			<p>Pineapple bun with butter was invented by the restaurant itself. It is a food developed purely from pineapple buns. It is made up of pineapple buns cut horizontally 
			and a thick slice of butter (or cream). The best way to eat pineapple bun with butter is to sandwich freshly baked pineapple buns with cold butter.
			In this way, the butter will be melted in the middle of the bag by the heat of the pineapple bun, and the melted butter on the bag's body will turn into golden yellow.</p>

		<div class="story_text3">       
			<h3>Egg waffles</h3><img src ="Image/Egg waffles.jpg" width="500px"/>
			<p>Egg waffles are an original traditional street snack in Hong Kong. It is said to have appeared in Hong Kong in the 1950s. At that time, there were many cracked eggs in 
			grocery stores that could not be sold. Because they didn't want to go to waste, some people suddenly thought about adding flour and butter. Wait until it is made into egg paste,
			Then it was poured into a mold and bake. The main ingredients of egg waffles include eggs, flour, evaporated milk, and sugar, which are golden brown when finished.</p>
